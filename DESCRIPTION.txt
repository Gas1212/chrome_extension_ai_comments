=== SINGLE PURPOSE DESCRIPTION (for Privacy form) ===
Generate AI-powered comment responses for Quora. The extension detects comment input fields on Quora pages and allows users to generate contextual responses using AI (via external API providers like Google Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic) based on the question or post content.

=== PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS ===

storage:
The storage permission is used to save user preferences locally, including: the selected AI provider (Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic), the user's API key for their chosen provider, the default response tone setting, and the preferred language for generated responses.

Host permissions (quora.com):
Host permissions for quora.com are required because the extension's sole purpose is to function on Quora pages. The content script needs to: detect comment input fields, read surrounding context (questions and answers) to provide relevant AI-generated responses, and insert generated text into comment fields.
